How to Set Up Your Raspberry Pi and Build Your Own Server from Scratch
Welcome to this guide that walks you through setting up a Raspberry Pi-based server and preparing it to run a Kubernetes cluster using modern tools and best practices. Whether you're exploring self-hosting or diving into edge computing, this is a great starting point.

ðŸ“¦ What's This All About?
This repository is intended to help you learn how to set up your own Raspberry Pi server and build a Kubernetes cluster using recommended technologies. Weâ€™ll cover both hardware and software requirements so you can start from scratch and progress confidently.

ðŸ§° What Youâ€™ll Need â€“ Hardware Checklist
Before we begin, make sure you have the right hardware in place. Hereâ€™s a list of essentials and recommendations to get started:

âœ… Required Hardware
Raspberry Pi 4 or Pi 5

Minimum: 4 GB RAM

Recommended: 8 GB RAM (for future scalability)

Cooling Solution

Raspberry Pi cooler or fan to prevent overheating.

Power Supply

Official 27W Raspberry Pi charger or an equivalent one with stable power output.

Case (Optional)

A protective case for better airflow and portability.

Display Cables

Two micro HDMI to HDMI cables if you plan to connect to a monitor.

Storage Options

Recommended SD Card: Class A2 U3, 256 GB (e.g., SanDisk Extreme or Samsung Pro Plus)

Better Performance: SSD or NVMe SSD with compatible USB base.

Imaging Software

Raspberry Pi Imager or similar tool to flash the OS onto the storage device.

ðŸ’» Software Setup â€“ Preparing the OS
With your hardware ready, itâ€™s time to install an operating system on your Pi. Hereâ€™s how to go about it:

1. Download a 64-bit OS Image
Pick an OS that suits your use case. Some common options include:

Ubuntu Server (Recommended for Kubernetes)

Raspberry Pi OS

Kali Linux

Windows IoT Core

Make sure to download the 64-bit version for better compatibility and performance.

2. Install Raspberry Pi Imager
Download it from the official Raspberry Pi website.

Install it on your laptop or desktop.

3. Flash the OS Image
Insert the SD card or SSD into your computer.

Launch Raspberry Pi Imager.

Choose the downloaded OS image.

Select the correct storage device.

Follow the on-screen steps to flash the image.

Once done, insert the storage device into the Raspberry Pi and power it up. Youâ€™ll be ready to begin your journey into server hosting and Kubernetes!

ðŸš€ Next Steps
Now that your Raspberry Pi is set up with a bootable OS, the next phase is configuring it for a Kubernetes cluster and deploying services. In upcoming posts, weâ€™ll guide you through:

Kubernetes installation on ARM

Setting up networking

Deploying your first containerized apps

Using monitoring and observability tools

Stay tuned!
