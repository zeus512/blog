# 📢 Getting Started with Python as an absolute beginner

Python is a very well known programming language in the field of IT and Technology. It is very easy to learn and a very powerful programming language. It has effiecient high-level data structures and the object oriented programming approach is very simple. The syntax is very simple and the dynamic typing so that the data types are checked during the runtime makes it ideal for scripting and various other application development.

The Python website https://www.python.org/ has many freely distributed extensive standard libraries. It also contains distribution and third party Python modules, programs and tools with proper documentation.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

## Before the Main Course...

If you work in the environments where eventually you are bound to automate the tasks. Unix shell script or windows batch files may help in such situations but there are some complex tasks which are tedious to automate using the above mentioned methods. One could write a program for such using c/c++ but it may take a lot of time. You may have to use the libraries available in c/c++/java that takes time to write, compile and test. Python helps to work easier and a lot quicker in such cases.

It has very flexible arrays, dictionaries and offers extensive error checking than c language.

Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:

--> the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;

--> statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;

--> no variable or argument declarations are necessary.
