In today's world, every small business, startup, or even individual has a website. It's no longer just a luxury; it's a necessity. But how do you start? Here's a simple step-by-step guide to get you going. 
Now I'm not going to talk about stuff like - 
1. vision and mission of your website
2. how to target audience 
3. what type of content to post etc ... 
 This tutorial is purely on the tech side on how starting a website works.

Let's start with the simple steps: 
1. Search buy domain in google and a bunch of results popup - most of them are domain registrars and the price varies little bit. so choose the one with good support. I usually prefer goDaddy

2. You can occasionally find free domains on sites like freenom - but they share your profile details, and you end up with promotional content on your feed . However, if you are student and just want to explore the process, you can try it out with Temp-mail or disposable mail combinations
3. Let's assume we found a good domain name and registered it. Next step is to host it - what does hosting mean here ? -
   - In simple terms, with domain name - you own a name across internet, but now to show any content under this name - you need a server connected to internet - where you can upload your website files.
   - So hosting is nothing but renting a server space to upload your files and make them available on internet.
   - There are many hosting providers like Bluehost, Hostgator, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc. Choose one based on your budget and requirements. 
   - Again, there are free hosting providers like Infinity Free, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc. but they have one or other limitations on custom domains and features. we can explore them later
4. Once you have hosting, you need to point your domain to the hosting server. This is done by updating the DNS records of your domain to point to the IP address of your hosting server. Most hosting providers will give you the necessary DNS records to update.
   - If your domain name and hosting are from the same provider, this step is usually done automatically. 
   - If they are from different providers, you will need to log in to your domain registrar's control panel and update the DNS records to point to your hosting provider's nameservers.
   - For example, if you are using GoDaddy for your domain and Bluehost for hosting, you will need to update the nameservers in GoDaddy to point to Bluehost's nameservers.
   - This sounds complicated but most hosting providers have detailed documentation on how to do this, and it's straight forward.
5. Now that your domain is pointing to your hosting server, you can upload your website files to the server. This can be done using:
   - **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: You can use an FTP client like FileZilla to connect to your hosting server and upload your files.
   - **cPanel**: Most hosting providers offer a control panel (like cPanel) where you can upload files directly through a web interface.
   - **Git**: If you are using Git for version control, you can push your code to the server using Git commands.
   - **SSH (Secure Shell)**: If you have SSH access to your server, you can use commands like `scp` or `rsync` to upload files securely.
   - **Web-based file manager**: Some hosting providers offer a web-based file manager where you can upload files directly through your browser.
6. I personally, prefer using GitHub for version control and then deploying to hosting provider using Git. Most hosting providers have options to connect your GitHub repository and deploy automatically. This provides better backup and track on change log 
7. Once your files are uploaded, you can access your website by typing your domain name in a web browser. If everything is set up correctly, you should see your website live on the internet.

See, it's as simple as these steps.
Now, I know there's more to this process - like acquiring SSL certificates, redirections, SEO , page indexing, etc. But these are the basic steps to get your website up and running.

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to start a website, Let's dig into what happens in the background when we register a website name for ourselves :
## The Domain Name System (DNS) Explained

When you register a domain name, you're essentially renting a unique address on the internet. This address is managed by the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. 
Here's a simplified explanation of how DNS works:
1. **Domain Registration**: When you register a domain name, you provide your contact information and pay a fee to a domain registrar. This information is stored in a central database called the WHOIS database.
2. **DNS Records**: The domain registrar creates DNS records for your domain. These records include information about where your website is hosted, email servers, and other services associated with your domain.
3. **DNS Propagation**: After you update your DNS records, it takes time for the changes to propagate across the internet. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours, depending on various factors.
4. **DNS Resolution**: When someone types your domain name into a web browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS resolver (usually provided by the user's ISP). The resolver looks up the IP address associated with your domain name by querying the DNS records.
5. **Connecting to Your Server**: Once the resolver finds the IP address, it returns it to the browser, which then connects to your hosting server using that IP address. The server responds by sending the requested web page back to the browser, which displays it to the user.
